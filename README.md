### HELP NEEDED

Help needed for windows and mac build.

##### Packages

We really need help packaging CuteMarkEd. Especially for Linux and Mac OS X. For Linux there is already an [openSUSE Build Service project](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:cloose1974/CuteMarkEd), but it's outdated. Please contact me if you like to help.

##### Translations

We use [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/cutemarked) for the translations. Currently we have translations like Chinese, Czech, German or Greek. But we are always interested in more translations.
